* DynamoDB
* https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/
* Open-source: It's not open source, seems like it's proprietary to AWS.
* Data model: NoSQL, uses key-value pairing.
* Hosting: Amazon VPC (cloud), can set up local instances.
* Interfacing w/ java: Requires users to set up maven dependencies, install local instance of DynamoDB, and a series of additional steps to create a Spring Boot (?)
